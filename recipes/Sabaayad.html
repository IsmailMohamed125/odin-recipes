    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Sabaayad is a Somali flatbread made from flour. It is golden brown, crispy and flaky on the outside and soft on the inside. You can eat it with almost anything: honey, cinnamon sugar and a cup of tea, stew, sauce or by itself.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups flour</li>
        <li>1 - 1 1/2cup water</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
        <li>*Butter, to taste</li>
        <li>*1 teaspoon of honey or sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to make it</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the flour, oil and salt in deep bowl; add the water gently using your fingers Knead the dough until it turns very smooth for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Brush with oil, cover and set aside for half an hour.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 8 large balls. On a lightly floured surface, roll each piece into a rough circle about 8 inches in diameter.</li>
        <li>Brush oil on one side of the sabaayad and spread evenly fold to edges in to meet center fold, fold the other edges in, you should now have a square fold, set a side. Finish until you have applied the same method to all the pieces.</li>
        <li>Again on a floured surface roll each piece out into a circle and place it on a hot griddle over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Fry the sabaayad one at a time with little oil, turning them once each side is golden brown.</li>
        <li>The sabaayad will puff slightly and become crisp and brown. Drain the sabaayad on paper towels and serve warm.</li>
